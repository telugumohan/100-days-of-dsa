# 💯 100 Days of DSA

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfDSA** journey! 🚀  
For the next 100 days, I’ll be solving at least one Data Structures & Algorithms problem each day.  
This repository will serve as my public log, knowledge base, and reference library.

## 🧭 Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Master core DSA patterns and algorithms
- Prepare for competitive programming & interviews
- Build a well-organized code repository for future reference
- Stay consistent for 100 days straight ✨

## 📌 Repo Structure

This repo uses **branches** for organization:

### **1️⃣ Topic Branches**

- `arrays`
- `strings`
